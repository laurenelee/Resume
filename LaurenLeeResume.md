## Civic Engagement  
I am passionate about social justice and teaching my students ways to actively contribute and give back to the community we live in. Growing up, I struggled with learning because of Dyslexia. Only because of patient and persistent mentorship was I able to succeed and eventually enjoy the process of learning. As an adult, I care deeply about connecting with and empowering young girls through mentorship and advocacy.
